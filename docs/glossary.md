* **ACN (Agent Communication Network)**: The ACN is a peer-to-peer communication
network for autonomous economic agents.

* **Distributed**: Distributed systems or computing refers to networks whose 
nodes are physically separated, and who may be used to solve problems 
efficiently by dividing their workload.

* **Decentralized**: Decentralized systems or computing refers to networks whose
nodes are owned by different users, which may be used for peer-to-peer 
communication without a third-party intermediary acting as a central authority.

* **Skill**: A Skill encapsulates implementations Handler, Behaviour and Model, 
and may include any number of each of these components. 
[<a href="../skill">more</a>]

* **Task**: Encapsulate skill components that are scheduled for asynchronous 
execution. They are background processes that enable concurrency in the system,
which is a necessity for independence be their behaviour and decision-making.
